      faq: [
    { q: 'Can I convert a single HTML file to EPUB?', a: 'Yes. Single-page HTML files convert to simple EPUB ebooks. For multi-file websites, you may need to combine them first or convert section by section.' },
    { q: 'Will external images work in the EPUB?', a: 'Images linked via URLs are downloaded and packaged into the EPUB file. This ensures your ebook works offline with all images intact.' },
    { q: 'Does conversion preserve interactive elements?', a: 'Most static content is preserved. JavaScript and dynamic elements are converted to static equivalents since EPUB is primarily a reading format.' },
    { q: 'How long does HTML to EPUB conversion take?', a: 'For most HTML files under 50 pages, conversion takes 5-15 seconds. Complex pages with many images may take 1-2 minutes.' ],
